The resources between two chains cannot communicate simultaneously. Various methods have been proposed to enable communication and interaction between different chains. The main approaches to demonstrate cross-chain functionality are outlined below. More specific source code can be found in the root folder.



1. **Sidechain/Mainchain Bridging**: Establish a bridge between two blockchains allowing assets to transfer between them using smart contracts and trusted relays.

2. **Atomic Swaps**: Execute two atomic operations simultaneously on two chains, where one party locks assets on one chain while the other unlocks assets on the other using hashed timelock contracts and atomicity.

3. **Token Mapping**: Issue corresponding tokens on both chains and establish a mapping between them through smart contracts to facilitate token transfers between the chains.

4. **Sidechain Syncing**: Synchronize state between a main chain and a sidechain, allowing for replication of main chain state on the sidechain and handling cross-chain transactions through smart contracts.

5. **Multisig Wallets**: Utilize multisignature wallets to manage cross-chain assets, requiring signatures from all involved parties to execute cross-chain transactions and asset management.
